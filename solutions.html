                      <h2>Overview</h2>
                      <p>The first response that likely comes to mind for the removal of invasive plants is to get a shovel or larger digging aparatus and remove the plants in that way. With Giant hogweed and Japanese Knotweed both plants must be removed at the root which makes digging more difficult. Generally removal by digging is the most low-tech and is best suited to small amounts of invasive plants.

                      <h2>Cost</h2>
                      <p>In terms of raw materials digging can be one of the cheapest, as the price ranges from that of a decent shovel to that of an excavator. If removing knotwed main issue is that, due to how small a rizome has to be in order to regrow and the depth of the roots full removal by this technique takes multiple seasons, and if the growth of the plant is significant it takes quite some time. In the case of giant hogweed the plant must be pulled out at the root which can be dangerous due to the phototoxic sap.</p>

                      <h2>Effect</h2>
                      <p>With digging the larger the patch of invasive plants the less control one has over avoiding native species. The physical disturbance of the soil can make it difficult for native plants to regrow and if the digging is done without caution or careful disposal, the invasive species is likely to return or even spread. The risk to native plants is greater with giant hogweed as Knotweed patches tend to shade out competition.</p>

                  <h2>Overview</h2>
                  <p>Using the cover method as an invasive species removal technique involves covering an affected area with something like wood pulp, cardboard or a plastic tarp weighed down at the edges. This prevents the plants from accessing sunlight and slows or stops growth. This strategy must be implemented early in plant growth and one must check repeatedly for plants growing through the cracks.</p>

                  <h2>Cost</h2>
                  <p>The cost of the cover method varies depending on the plant and the size of the affected area. If can range from cardboard for simple low growing plants to a heavy tarp or more aggressive plants like knotweed. Mulch prices vary depending on the type of material but the price can range from 10$-12$ per cubic foot while tarps usually cost about 56 - 5 cents per square foot. </p>

                  <h2>Effect</h2>
                  <p>The cover method be made to work around plants that have already grown to a height where it grows beyond the mulch or to the point that the plastic can have holes cut for the plants to grow through. However, with invasive species such as giant hogweed where the early aggressive growing season is a large factor in their overpowering native plants any native plants that haven’t sprouted will be difficult to account for.

                  <h2>Overview</h2>
                  <p>The main weed-killers that are effective against knotweed and giant hogweed are glyphosphate based. Glyphosphate based weed-killers are usually applied via spray to the leaves of the plant. While relatively low in toxicity care should be employed to ensure that weed-killer does not infect the surrounding plants or environment. Users should check on the target plants within a few weeks to ensure that the weed-killer is affecting the target plants. However other methods see glyphosphate injected into the stems of plants.</p>

                  <h2>Effect</h2>
                  <p>The method of delivery is the biggest factor in whether chemical treatments affect native plants. Glyphosphate based weed killers have been known to cause problems with surrounding trees and plants when administered via spray. However the injection method usually contains the weed-killer to the plant it’s self. It is highly suggested that one checks the weather before attempting chemical treatment as rain or wind could scatter the chemical, both spreading the weed-killer and seriously impacting the effectiveness.</p>
